# desktopApp

This is the how i created a desktop icon that when doubled clicked, 
will run the bash script to launch the list-of-kanban boards. 

Please note;
this has only been tested on macos. you may have to modify somethings
in order for this to work on windows.

General Steps:
    1) If you want to use a custom icon image. It needs to be 512 x 512 pixles and
        saved as a .png format.
        create a new icon using "touch {name_of_script.command}.

    2) Initally go through the steps of running and npm install and npm run serve on
       your local machine. once the development enviroment is up and working. 
       Run an npm run build.

    3) Export the contents of the dist directory generated by the npm run build    command to a folder on your desktop. 

    4) In the folder on your desktop it should contain the optional custom icon image, bash script and contents of the npm run build dist directory. 

Bash Script:
    If you are going to use the bash script attached, please not you may have to configure it to your specific local machine setup. especially the paths. 
    In short, the script is launched when the icon is clicked. It navigates to that folder i created on my desktop that contains the npm run build dist directories contents. then it launches it.
